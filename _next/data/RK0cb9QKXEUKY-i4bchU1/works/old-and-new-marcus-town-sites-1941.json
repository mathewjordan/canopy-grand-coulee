Stevens Camp Kettle; Columbia River Reservoir Clearing Project.  Neg. No. 916; AIR VIEW OF OLD AND NEW MARCUS TOWN SITES ****CLOSE UP VIEW. (June 23, 1941) All that is left of the old town site of old Marcus is seen in this air view looking north. The new townsite of Marcus, where many of the houses from the old town have been moved, is seen about the New Marcus school on a bench above the future highwater line at the right. The few remaining buildings remaining on Marcus's Main Street are soon to be removed. The railroad bridge in the foreground that until recently carried the Republic branch of the Great Northern railroad across the Columbia River is to be removed. Reservoir lake water will soon cover much of the old townsite of Marcus, which was first platted in 1890.
