WPA workers will demolish and burn all buildings left standing before the water reaches this area sometime in June. Here we see Sidney W. Worzberg, (sic) and Anthony Gendron talking over old times in Marcus before Wurzburg's store at the foot of Main Street. Mr. Wurzberg (sic) was brought to Marcus at the age of 16 months by his father who built this store, in 1896, and which store has been operated by the Father and then the son continuously since 1906. Anthony Gendron, one of the oldest Marcus residents, came to the town in 1889 and helped clear the streets when the town was platted by homesteader Marcus Oppenheimer, after whom the town was named, and Joseph Monoghen on June 27, 1890.\r\n\r\nCaption on verso: US WPA 565\r\n\r\n[Grand Coulee Dam 294]"]}},{"label":{"none":["Digital Collection"]},"value":{"none":["Grand Coulee Dam Collection"]}},{"label":{"none":["Order Number"]},"value":{"none":["DAM201"]}},{"label":{"none":["Ordering Information"]},"value":{"none":["To order a reproduction, inquire about permissions, or for information about prices see:\r\nhttp://www.lib.washington.edu/specialcollections/services/reproduction/reproduction\r\nPlease cite the Order Number"]}},{"label":{"none":["Physical Description"]},"value":{"none":["silver gelatin, b&w"]}},{"label":{"none":["Repository"]},"value":{"none":["University of Washington Libraries.
